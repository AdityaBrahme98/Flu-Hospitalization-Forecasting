# Flu-Hospitalization-Forecasting

• Influenza(flu)is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.
  
• Flu is a seasonal burden and flu epidemics cause 140,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 – 52,000 deaths each year.
  • Forecasting influenza outcomes is inherently challenging due to seasonal variation, local and global dynamics, compounded by the continuous evolution of flu viruses, resulting in distinct characteristics for each flu season.
  • In this effort, we develop a data-driven solution to forecast in fluenza hospitalizations in the USA. Specifically, our multi-resolution approach captures both local and global characteristics for modelling weekly hospitalization dynamics during the flu season.
